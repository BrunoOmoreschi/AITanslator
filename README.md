This is a school project implementation of an AI translator using the Facebook M2M100 418m model.
Its simple and have the CLI and GUI (Kivy) version.

The model can be local or downloaded from Hugging face.
The GUI still doesnt look preety, but it is only functional. As a proof of concept is enought.
